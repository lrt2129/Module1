This is my first project in Creative Embedded Systems, in which I was asked to create generative art using an ESP32. Using the Arduino IDE, I adapted code to create a visual display of a verse in Taylor Swift's song All Too Well. For the final installation, I atttached a soldered JST connector connected to a LiPo battery to the ESP32, which I hung from the ceiling along with others' projects.
